My worked notebooks as per the course: Practical Numerical Computing with Python by Lorena Barba

Link to the course material : https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc

The course is aimed for first-year graduate and senior undergraduate students. It gives a foundation in scientific computing and introduces numerical methods for solving differential equations. 
The course material is available in the form of interactive jupyter notebooks with code blocks, along with references for further reading.

Being my first course in Python programming and numerical methods, I had to put in quite some time to learn every module and complete the assignments successfully. However, in the end it was a rewarding experience which introduced me to the beauty of differential equations and the various numerical schemes to solve them.
