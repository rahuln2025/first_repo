My worked notebooks as per the course: Practical Numerical Computing with Python by Lorena Barba

Link to the course material : https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc

The course is aimed for first-year graduate and senior undergraduate students. It gives a foundation in scientific computing and introduces numerical methods for solving differential equations. 
The course material is available in the form of interactive jupyter notebooks with code blocks, along with references for further reading.

Here is a summary of the modules and the code snippets from my assignment solutions: 

**Module 1: The Phugoid Model of Glider Flight**

-_Problem_: Phugoid model of glider flight described by set of two nonlinear ODEs.
-_Topics covered_: a) Euler's method, 2nd-order RK, and leapfrog; b) consistency, convergence testing; c) stability Computational techniques: array operations with NumPy; symbolic computing with SymPy; ODE integrators and libraries; writing and using functions.

**Module 2: Space and Time - Introduction to finite-difference solutions of PDEs**

-_Problem_: Linear convection equation in one dimension.
-_Topics_: Finite differencing in PDEs, CFL condition, numerical diffusion, accuracy of finite difference approximations via Tyalor sieries, consistency and stability, introduction to conservation laws, array operations with Numpy, symbolic computing with SymPy. 

**Module 3: Riding the wave: Convection Problems**

-_Problem_: Traffic-flow model to study different solutions for problems with shocks.
-_Topics_: Upwind scheme, Lax-Friedrichs scheme, Lax-Wendroff scheme, MacCormack scheme, MUSCL scheme. 

**Module 4: Spreading out: Diffusion Problems**

-_Problem_: Diffusion (heat) equation as a problem to solve parabolic PDEs. Start with 1D heat equaiton and move to 2D heat equation.
-_Topics_: Implicit and Explicit Schemes with boundary condition implementation, Crank-Nocolson Scheme
